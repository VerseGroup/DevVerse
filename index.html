        <h1> DevVerse </h1>
        <p> DevVerse is an extension of github (consider it github++) for 
            mobile that makes development easier. We focus on bringing 
            important features missing in the Github Mobile app to users and 
            to ensure that they can use github on the go with Twilio notications. We
            also ensure productivity on the go with custom project boards to keep track of their projects and assignments.
